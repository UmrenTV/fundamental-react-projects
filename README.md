# What are these projects?

The idea is to build a number of small projects, divided by React functionalities, so when I teach people about coding in React / Next to have small bite sized projects to use as reference for them, as well as for me, whenever I need to remind myself of some functionality.
Also to show my students how to use Git.

## Project by functionality:

- Birthday Buddy: How to use useState hook to manage state in React.
